# Hall Voltage

This repository contains (will contain) data from the Hall voltage experiment to determine the Hall coefficient and charge carrier type for an unknown sample (either silver or tungsten).

## Aim and basic configuration

The experiment configuration involves a U-shape iron core over which two EM coils are fitted. In top of the 'U' are the magnets that will generate a roughly uniform magnetic field when the EM coils have a current running through them (which ranges from 0 - 10 A). The current is supplied by a DC source. Magnetic side distortions are ngeligible if the gap between the magnets are kept to a minimum, but this is a source of uncertainity in the measurements. 

Between these magnets is placed the sample (either tungsten or silver) in the form of a thin (0.5 micrometre) strip which is attached to a another DC source. The current (called the transverse current) running through this sample has a range of 0 - 20 A, but a constant current is selected for the strip. In this experiment, we are concerned with calculating the Hall voltage which depends on the transverse current (which is constant) and the the changing magnetic field through the sample.
